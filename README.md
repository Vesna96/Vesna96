- 👋 Hi, I’m @Vesna96 Vesna. I am a graduate software engineer. I have a Bachelor's degree from the Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Department of Computer Science.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming languages and foreign languages. I am a Software Engineer and an English Teacher. I have been teaching English language online (ESL Teacher)
for more than a year and I've taught more than 1400 classes. In my free time I like to read books and to write short stories.
I am very passionate about learning new foreign languages. Right now I can spreak: English, Serbian, Spanish, German, French and a little bit of Turkish. 
I am also very passionate about programming and I can't wait to learn as many programming languages as I can and to be the best possible version of myself. 
I am a team player, a communicative person and I am very persistent when I am learning something new. 
I never give up, I like new challenges because they represent and opportunity to show my skills. I am a hard working person, very detail-oriented in my programming.
