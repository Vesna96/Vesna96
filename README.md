- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vesna. I am a graduate software engineer. I have a Bachelor's degree from the Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Department of Computer Science.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming languages and foreign languages. I am a Software Engineer and an English Teacher. 
I can speak: English, Serbian, Spanish, German, French and a little bit of Turkish. 
I am a team player, a communicative person and I am very persistent when I am learning something new.
I like new challenges because they represent an opportunity for me to learn new things and to develop myself as an engineer. 
I am a hard working person, very detail-oriented in my programming. 
This year I participated in a science conference with my disertation theses related to Google Apps Script.
